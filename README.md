This is the repository for my personal website and blog. It's powered by [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
(what isn't these days ;). It's easy to get started:

1. Clone the repository:
   `git clone [url-to-repo]`
2. Install dependencies:
   `bundle install`
3. Serve it up:
   `jekyll serve` (I also like to use [`--watch`](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage) and [`--drafts`](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/drafts))
