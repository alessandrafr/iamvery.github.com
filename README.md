# [iamvery.com](http://iamvery.com)

This is the repository for my personal website and blog. It's easy to use:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:iamvery/iamvery.github.com.git && cd iamvery.github.com
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   bundle install
   ```

3. Serve it up:

   ```
   jekyll serve
   ```

   (I also like to use [`--watch`](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage) and [`--drafts`](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/drafts)
