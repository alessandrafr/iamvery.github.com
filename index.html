  <h1>Who I am</h1>
  <p>
    My name is <em><strong>Jay Hayes</strong></em>. I am a husband and programmer. I am a 26 year old CS graduate
    from the University of Alabama in Huntsville. My wife and I live in Florence, Alabama and own a dance studio
    (<a href="http://soledancestudio.com">http://soledancestudio.com</a>). Over the past few years, I have developed
    a deep passion for doing web development *right*. I don't claim to know it all, but I am always working to improve
    my craft.
  </p>

  <h1>What I've done</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>Designed, developed, and maintained large web applications</li>
    <li>Created, configured, and managed application servers</li>
    <li>Worked in a test-first fashion</li>
    <li>Worked on an "agile" team</li>
    <li>Invested many hours in learning as much as possible in the web development sphere</li>
    <li>Listened to hundreds of hours of podcasts to keep up with the latest in the community</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Where I'm going</h1>

  <p>
    My recent work has driven me to learn and use a lot of amazing open source projects. I
    strive to become more involved in the open source community. I want to surround myself with
    people who are a lot smarter than me so that I can continually grow as a professional
    programmer. I never want to stop learning!
