Who I am
========

My name is ***Jay Hayes***. I am a husband and programmer. I am a #{Time.now.year - 1986} year
old CS graduate from the University of Alabama in Huntsville. My wife and I live in Florence,
Alabama and own a dance studio (<http://soledancestudio.com>). Over the past few years, I have
developed a deep passion for doing web development *right*. I don't claim to know it all, but
I am always working to improve my craft.

What I've done
==============

* Designed, developed, and maintained large web applications
* Created, configured, and managed application servers
* Worked in a test-first fashion
* Worked on an "agile" team
* Invested many hours in learning as much as possible in the web development sphere
* Listened to hundreds of hours of podcasts to keep up with the latest in the community

Where I'm going
===============

My recent work has driven me to learn and use a lot of amazing open source projects. I
strive to become more involved in the open source community. I want to surround myself with
people who are a lot smarter than me so that I can continually grow as a professional
programmer. I never want to stop learning!
