title: Bias Towards Actionable
---

Developing a [bias towards action](http://www.dtelepathy.com/blog/productivity/key-to-productivity-developing-a-bias-towards-action)
will free you to get things done. Day to day this means having a tendency to
stop talking about doing something and **DO IT**.

For example, you may have noticed a small typo on an Intranet article. Rather
than contacting your Web Masterâ„¢ and requesting an internal review of
apostrophe's in the contraction "it's", **FIX IT** (or at least open a pull
request).

## Actionable Communication

In your quest to become an action hero, you will begin to develop the habit
of converting input into actionable language. It can be really hard to keep
momentum when incoming communication is not already actionable. You receive an
email that says:

> Good morning, Hank. I was glancing at [project name] this morning while
sipping my coffee and looking at animated GIFs (lol checkout this cat [link]),
and I noticed that the homepage says "Welcome hime!". Do you know who "hime"
is? Was that the name of the person that rolled off the project last year? I
don't really know, but last night on tv did you see...

Nestled awkwardly between feline animations and drugs (only explanation) is a
hint that there is a copy error on the homepage of your product. The email is
distracting at best. You're asking yourself "Why wasn't this reported in [issue
tracker]?" "The error is quite glaring, why not just fix it and open a pull
request?" I don't know, but don't be that person.

## Communicate Actionably

You can't change the way others communicate, but **you _can_ change how you
communicate**. I charge you to always be mindful of your communication. If you
don't know what you're trying to say, stop and think about it. If you need to
open a discussion, be open about that and schedule time to talk (ACTION!).

Read emails before you send them. Too long? Rip out the cruft. Does it meander
around the point without stating it? Reword and restructure until the action
jumps out of the page. A great way to identify inactionable communication is
when you struggle with _what to do_ (ACTION?). You can't delete the email,
_something_ should be said or done... When you form communication, think about
what you want to see done as a result and say that thing.

If you're a developer this goes for story writing as well. Nail the criteria
for acceptance. Spell it out. You and anyone else on the project should be able
to pluck the story 6 months later and understand the requested behavior in
no time.

**Developing a habit of actionable communication produces results. You're able
to affect the productivity of your team with your communication.**
