<h1>Who I am</h1>
<p>
  <img class="pull-right" title="Les and I" src="/images/jay-and-les.jpg" />
  I am a Christian, husband and <a href="https://www.bignerdranch.com/about_us/nerds/jay_hayes">nerd</a>.
  My wife and I live in Florence, Alabama and own a dance studio
  (<a href="http://soledancestudio.com">Sole</a>). Over the past few years, I
  have developed a deep passion for doing web development <em>right</em>. I
  don't it all, but I'm always working to improve my craft.

<h1>What I do</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Solve interesting problems</li>
  <li>Build web applications</li>
  <li>Always be testing</li>
</ul>

<h1>Where I'm going</h1>

<p>
  My recent work has driven me to learn and use a lot of amazing open source
  projects. I strive to become more involved in the open source community. I
  want to surround myself with people who are a lot smarter than me so that I
  can continually grow as a professional programmer. I never want to stop
  learning!
