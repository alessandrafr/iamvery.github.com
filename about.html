<h1>Who I am</h1>
<p>
  I love God, my wife, my children, and you.
  I work remotely from my home in in North Alabama.
  Over the years, I have developed a deep passion for building software.
  I don't know it all, but I'm always learning.
</p>

<h1>What I do</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Solve interesting problems</li>
  <li>Write quality code</li>
  <li>Commit often</li>
  <li>Always be testing</li>
</ul>

<h1>Where I'm going</h1>
<p>
  My recent work has driven me to use a lot of amazing open source software.
  I'm trying become more involved in the open source community.
  I love meeting people while traveling and speaking at conferences.
  I strive to surround myself with people who are smarter than me so I can continue to grow.
  I never want to stop learning!
