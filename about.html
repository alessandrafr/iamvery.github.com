<h1>Who I am</h1>
<p>
  I am a Christian, husband and, <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/about-us/nerds/jay-hayes.html">nerd</a>.
  My wife and I live in Florence, Alabama and own a <a href="http://soledancestudio.com">dance studio</a>.
  Over the years, I have developed a deep passion for programming things. I
  don't know it all, but I'm always learning.
</p>

<h1>What I do</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Solve interesting problems</li>
  <li>Write quality code</li>
  <li>Commit often</li>
  <li>Always be testing</li>
</ul>

<h1>Where I'm going</h1>
<p>
  My recent work has driven me to use a lot of amazing open source software.
  I'm trying become more involved in the open source community. I strive to
  surround myself with people who are smarter than me so I can continue to
  grow. I never want to stop learning!
