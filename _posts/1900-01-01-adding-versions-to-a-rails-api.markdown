title: "Adding Versions to a Rails API"
draft: true
---

When you create an [application programming interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface),
you're establishing a contract with everyone who uses it. This too is true for
[web service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service) APIs. As soon as
someone begins using an API, changes require coordination between all clients
to prevent breakage. This costs precious time and money. In order to allow
breaking changes to an interface, we can version it so clients may specify
exactly what representation they expect for their requests. Then they are able
to decide for themselves when it is timely and cost-effective to upgrade their
dependency.

## An Example API

**Note**: Each heading in this walkthrough will have one or more accompanying
commits. You can work through it yourself or follow along [on Github](https://github.com/iamvery/rails-api-example).

---

As a baseline for this post, we'll consider a very simple, contrived API. This
API has only one resource `/articles`. You can grab a copy of the example by
cloning it from Github and setting up as follows:

Clone the repo:

    $ git clone git@github.com:iamvery/rails-api-example.git
    $ cd rails-api-example

Checkout the repo in it's "initial" state, before versions are implemented:

    $ git checkout -b starting-point initial-api-implementation

Install dependencies, watch specs pass:

    $ bundle install
    $ bin/rspec
    ... 0 failures

Once you've got the project setup, run the local server and see what
the [article](https://github.com/iamvery/rails-api-example/blob/7b664c797e1e896f84abcc377e5c507a161f4d31/app/controllers/articles_controller.rb)
response looks like:

Run the local rails server:

    # Do this in a separate window so you can keep it around
    $ bin/rails server

Make a request for the articles' JSON representation:

    $ curl http://localhost:3000/articles.json
    [{"id":123,"name":"The Things"}]

## Versioning is a Thing

At this point our API has a single, unversioned articles resource. As a first
step we'll introduce versioning as an [internet media type](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type)
parameter.

### Namespaces (commit [`b21a0a91`](https://github.com/iamvery/rails-api-example/commit/b21a0a918c65892376ccbebaf96057051795afc0))

Namespacing it a great way to keep code organized. We'll wrap our existing
controller in a `V1` module to establish our "version 1".

Move `app/controllers/articles_controller.rb` to
`app/controllers/v1/articles_controller.rb` and wrap the class in a module.

{% gist 10328874 %}

Since we don't want to affect our URI structure for the resource, we can use
the `:module` scope to namespace the controller and not the URI.

{% gist 10328982 %}

### Route Constraint (commits [`5d304f19`](https://github.com/iamvery/rails-api-example/commit/5d304f1983107c4cb609d83a5b6b209ba4064287) and [`0ec91c6c`](https://github.com/iamvery/rails-api-example/commit/0ec91c6c6cce5113b7f9e1d9484a3f2d94936ad5))

Next we need to tell Rails how to route requests for different versioned
representations. We can do this effectively by using a [route constraint](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#advanced-constraints)
that checks for a version specified in the request's `accept` header.

{% gist 10329040 %}

We can use this constraint to route requests based on the version specified in
the request's accept header.

{% gist 10329098 %}

With this change, we now must specify the desired version in the request's
headers to get the desired response. If your development server is still
running at this point, it will probably need to be restarted.

    $ curl -H "accept: application/json; version=1" http://localhost:3000/articles
    [{"id":123,"name":"The Things"}]

### Version 2 (commit [`5bd29d0b`](https://github.com/iamvery/rails-api-example/commit/5bd29d0bb92c10c3884b1f5aa8fac0886e1f0205))

Now that we have namespaces for our versioned controllers and constraints for
routing, we can introduce a version 2 articles representation. Version 2 will
wrap the response in a root node. This representation is not backwards
compatable with the version 1 representation, thus requiring a new versioned
representation.

{% gist 10329142 %}

{% gist 10329174 %}

We can request the version 2 representation as well as version 1 as follows.

    $ curl -H "accept: application/json; version=2" http://localhost:3000/articles
    {"articles":[{"id":123,"name":"The Things"}]}

    $ curl -H "accept: application/json; version=1" http://localhost:3000/articles
    [{"id":123,"name":"The Things"}]

## Version Representations, Not Locations

I was first tuned to this idea by a [post from Steve Klabnik](http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2011-07-03-nobody-understands-rest-or-http#i_want_my_api_to_be_versioned)
about REST and HTTP. Later I dug a little deeper and found a [long answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/398564)
on StackOverflow that goes into more detail. The prevaling sentiment is:

> resource URIs that API users depend on should be permalinks

This cannot be true if the version is included in the URI, which changes over
time.  Using Klabnik's suggestion we push this knowledge into the request
headers and keep URIs permanent for all future representations of our
resources.

## Internet Media Types

The above example deals only in the `application/json` media type. The idea of
"versioning" doesn't apply very well to the generic "json" type. That is, it
doesn't make good sense to say "here you're seeing version 1 json, and over
here we have version 2 json". For that reason it may be desirable to create
a custom [vendor media type](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type#Vendor_tree)
to represent our app's responses.

### The Type (commit [`dbbf6ea7`](https://github.com/iamvery/rails-api-example/commit/dbbf6ea77c433937da41e466b6bf2266a0d8cfd1))

First we registier a new type with Rails and give it a name.

{% gist 10435700 %}

### Responding (commit [`17b85059`](https://github.com/iamvery/rails-api-example/commit/17b850599f2546600475b3a525e71c3afff0abbe))

Now we can adjust our resource to respond to our custom type.

{% gist 10435853 %}

With this change we can now make requests of our custom type.

    $ curl -H "accept: application/vnd.articles+json; version=2" http://localhost:3000/articles
    {"articles":[{"id":123,"name":"The Things"}]}

    $ curl -H "accept: application/vnd.articles+json; version=1" http://localhost:3000/articles
    [{"id":123,"name":"The Things"}]

### Bonus: URI Format Suffixes (commit [`323fe034`](https://github.com/iamvery/rails-api-example/commit/323fe034d4135a9a2aaa5b801509eb7c6fc38b7b))

You may have noticed that I stopped using format suffixes for requests early in
the post (ex. `/articles.json`). This was intentional so that we could arrive
at custom media types. It is however somewhat common to include such suffixes
for requested resources. Unfortnately as our example exists, Rails becomes
confused into thinking that we're requesting pure JSON rather than our
"articles flavored JSON". We can address this by responding to both formats.

{% gist 10436242 %}

Now we can make request including the suffix.

    $ curl -H "accept: application/vnd.articles+json; version=2" http://localhost:3000/articles.json
    {"articles":[{"id":123,"name":"The Things"}]}

    $ curl -H "accept: application/vnd.articles+json; version=1" http://localhost:3000/articles.json
    [{"id":123,"name":"The Things"}]

There is one caveat, however. The content type of the response will be
`application/json` rather than our custom type. I provide a little more
information in my [commit notes](https://github.com/iamvery/rails-api-example/commit/323fe034d4135a9a2aaa5b801509eb7c6fc38b7b).

## Conclusion

Versioning code is a Good Thingâ„¢. It allows us to continue to extend our APIs
without breaking compatablility for existing users. Introducing API versions
after a release may be a little painful, but it's doable.

* What do you think of this solution?
* How do you think it'd work at scale with a real system?
