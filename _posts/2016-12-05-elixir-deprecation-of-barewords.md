title: On Elixir's Deprecation of Barewords
tags:

I subscribe to the [Elixir language core mailing list][core-list] as a means of keeping my finger on the pulse of the language. A [post of particular interest][the-post] has recently fired up the discussion. **Elixir 1.4 introduces a warning for function invocation without parenthesis.** This style, commonly referred to as "barewords" makes variables and zero-arity function invocations look syntactically identical.

```elixir
self # Q: Is it a local variable or a function with no arguments? A: It Depends.‚Ñ¢
```

**To date, I have never written a line of Elixir that violates my strict loyalty to barewords style, but today I'm fine with this change.** Given a little reflection and the well-stated reasons for the change in the above-reference post, I'll go along with the ride. Allow me to explain.

## Functions and Values

Elixir is a functional programming language. As such Elixir maintains a strong distinction between functions and values (data). Values do not have functionality. You cannot invoke a _method_ on a value as you might in an object-centric language like Ruby. If you wish to perform some work on a value, it is passed as a parameter to a function.

The barewords style that I have grown to love acts to subtly obscure this distinction. You must look around in context to determine whether a bareword is simply a reference to a variable or a function invocation that may very well cost computation. As much as you may want a bareword function to read as a _value_, a value it is not. At the simplest it's a function that returns a literal at which point, you might want to check out module attributes or macros.

Barewords also introduce some ambiguity that can lead to real confusion. For example, there was recently [a subtle bug][bug] in the [elixirkoans.io][koans] project that would have been caught with this warning. Having forgotten to name a parameter in the function, things went on "working" because the zero-arity function `Kernel.node/0` was automatically included.

**It feels a little offputting to me that a function (zero-arity) might be masquerading as a value (bareword).** The small parenthetical tax paid to reinforce the function/value distinction seems worth it.

## Change is Hard

It's always hard to lose something you love, but these struggles are inevitable. I am very thankful for Jos√© and team for being willing to make the hard decisions to keep the language lean and spry. Keep up the fine works, folks.

Here's to you fig leaf operator `()`. üçª Keep us from baring all.
