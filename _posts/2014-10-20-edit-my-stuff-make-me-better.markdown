title: Edit My Stuff, Make Me Better
---

Today I added a public edit button to my site. While I honestly give it my very
best, I still make a ton of cringe-worthy mistakes in writing. Now you can
help make me better, and I'll get all the credit! Wow, what a great deal!

Each page links to the edit resource on Github for that document. If you make
an edit, it will be done in a fork that can be submitted back to me as a pull
request. Fix a typo? Merged. Fix terrible grammar? Merged. Cat gif? Merged.

Now we play the waiting game...
