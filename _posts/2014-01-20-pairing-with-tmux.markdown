title: Pairing with tmux
---

I had the opportunity to give a Big Nerd Ranch Tech Talk last week [Pairing
with tmux](https://speakerdeck.com/iamvery/pairing-with-tmux). In the talk,
I offered a simple solution for remote pair programming with the popular
[tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net) command line tool. [Check it out!](https://vimeo.com/84434957)
